## Implementation Details

### Entity Framework (EF)

Using EF as our Object-Relational Mapping / Persistence Framework.

### [Repository Pattern]

Sample implementation of [Repository Pattern] defined by Mosh Hamedani

- A Repository mediates between the domain and data mapping layers, acting like an **in-memory collection** of domain objects.
- Minimizing duplicate query logic by the basic encapsulation principle.
- Promotes testability.

[Repository Class](https://github.com/sanchez-franco/AdventureWorks/blob/c2853d4ef3a9b1e77d951fc4077a9049be0ea868/AdventureWorks.Data.Repository/Repository.cs#L9)

**NOTE: A current issue that I encounter using EF is the [N + 1 Problem]. Please make sure when you create your queries to address this issue.**

### Unit of Work Pattern (UOW)

- Maintains a list of objects affected by a business transaction and coordinates the writing out of changes.

### Unit of Work Pattern + Repository Pattern

### [Factory Method]

- Using the creational pattern [Factory Method] to promote loose coupling.
- Promotes testability.

### Dependency Injection Pattern (DI)

- By definition, Dependency Injection (DI) is an object-oriented programming design pattern that allows us to develop loosely coupled code.
- This is accomplished by the Inversion of Control principle (IoC), the flow depends on the defined abstractions to be implemented that is built up during program execution.
- We use out of the box containers in our Web API project to configure this as follows.

### Web API Bearer Token

Screenshots to call our Web API using [Postman]

- Use out of the box configuration in our Web API project and use the integration to our DB to authenticate the user.

![Get Token](/Images/GetToken.PNG)

- Using our token to call crud methods in our Web API.

### Unit Testing

- I've created a small Unit Test project to check our validation process on the Authentication Service.
- There are a bunch of frameworks to do this, currently I use [Moq] to be able to Mock our abstractions
- Another good tool for Unit Testing that I like to use (not currently in this project) is [AutoFixture], since it helps you save a lot of time by autogenerating entities based on parameters.
- All of this can be accomplished since we used abstractions in our N-Tier Application, which made our code not tightly coupled.
